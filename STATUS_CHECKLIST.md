## ‚è≥ PENDING - Backend & Configuration

### Backend API (Required)
- [ ] **POST /api/location/update** - Endpoint to receive handyman location updates
  - Should accept: bookingId, handymanId, latitude, longitude, timestamp
  - Should return: success/error response
  
- [ ] **GET /api/location/handyman/{bookingId}** - Endpoint to fetch handyman location
  - Should return: location data or 404 if not available
  
- [ ] **Database/Storage** - Store handyman locations
  - Options: MySQL/PostgreSQL table or Redis cache
  - See BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS.md for schema details
  
- [ ] **Authentication** - Secure the API endpoints
  - JWT tokens or API keys
  - Verify permissions (handyman can only update their own location)
  - Verify customer can only view locations for their bookings

### Configuration (Quick Fixes)
- [ ] **Update backend URL** in `location_tracking_service.dart`:
  ```dart
  // Line 8: Change from placeholder to your actual backend URL
  static const String _baseUrl = 'https://your-actual-backend.com/api';
  ```

- [ ] **Enable/Disable polling** in `booking_content_detail.dart`:
  ```dart
  // Line 87: Currently commented out
  // Uncomment to disable polling until backend is ready:
  // return;
  ```

### Optional Improvements
- [ ] **WebSocket implementation** - For real-time updates (optional, polling works too)
- [ ] **Error user feedback** - Show error messages to user when API fails
- [ ] **Offline mode** - Cache location updates when offline
- [ ] **Battery optimization** - Adjust polling frequency based on battery level
- [ ] **Custom marker icon** - Replace blue marker with custom handyman icon
- [ ] **Location history** - Show handyman's travel path on map
- [ ] **ETA calculation** - Calculate estimated time of arrival based on speed

## üêõ Current Issues

### Error Spam (Expected - No Backend Yet)
- **Issue:** Getting "FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 1) <html>" errors
- **Reason:** App is trying to connect to placeholder URL `https://your-backend-api.com/api`
- **Solution:** 
  1. Either disable polling (uncomment return statement on line 87)
  2. Or implement backend API first
  3. Then update the URL in location_tracking_service.dart

---

## üìã Next Steps Priority

### High Priority (Required for Production)
1. **Build backend API** - Implement the two endpoints
2. **Update backend URL** - Replace placeholder in code
3. **Test integration** - Verify handyman tracking works end-to-end
4. **Add authentication** - Secure the API

### Medium Priority (Recommended)
5. **Error handling UI** - Show user-friendly error messages
6. **Loading states** - Show loading indicators during API calls
7. **Testing** - Unit tests and integration tests

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
8. **WebSocket upgrade** - For real-time updates
9. **Optimization** - Reduce battery/data usage
10. **UI improvements** - Custom markers, animations
